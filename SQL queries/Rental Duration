# SQL Query: Rental Duration Analysis
# The following query is designed to extract aggregate information about the rental duration of films.
# It computes the shortest and longest rental periods, the average rental duration (rounded to a whole number), and the total number of entries with a non-null 'rental_duration' value.
# Additionally, it counts the total number of rows in the 'film' table to provide context to the aggregate figures.

SELECT MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
   MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,
   round(AVG(rental_duration),0) AS avg_rental_duration,
   COUNT(rental_duration) AS count_rental_duration,
   COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM film
