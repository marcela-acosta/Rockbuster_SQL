# Project: Rockbuster Online Video Rental Service Analysis

**Rockbuster, a global movie rental company, is transitioning to an online video rental service in response to the growing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. This project involves collaborating with Rockbuster's Business Intelligence team to strategize the launch of this new online platform.**
