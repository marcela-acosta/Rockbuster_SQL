# SQL Query: Revenue by Country
# This query provides a report of revenue by country, the total number of customers per country, and the percentage of total revenue that each country represents.
# It uses a common table expression (CTE) to first calculate the total revenue and customer count per country.
# Then, it calculates the total revenue from all payments. 
# Finally, it joins these two results to calculate the revenue percentage for each country and orders the results by the number of customers descending.
